# CollabCanvas Development Task List

This document outlines the complete implementation plan for the Figma clone project, organized into 39 progressive Pull Requests (PRs).

**‚ö†Ô∏è TDD APPROACH:** This task list follows Test-Driven Development principles. For each feature, tests are written FIRST, then implementation follows to make tests pass.

**üéØ SIMPLIFIED TESTING:** Tests focus on **core functionality and happy paths only**. We're not aiming for 100% coverage or testing every edge case - just ensuring the main features work correctly.

## Notes

- **TDD WORKFLOW:** For each feature, follow this exact order:
  1. Write tests (PR with "Tests" in title)
  2. Run tests - they should FAIL
  3. Implement feature (PR with "Implementation" in title)
  4. Run tests - they should PASS
  5. Do NOT modify tests to make them pass (unless tests were incorrect)
- Each PR should be reviewed and tested before merging
- Update AI_LOG.md for all AI-related interactions
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Keep PRs focused and atomic for easier review
- Tests ensure quality and catch regressions early

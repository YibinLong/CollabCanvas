## 🎯 Examples

### Simple PR (No User Setup)
```
docs/pr-completions/pr4/
└── PR4_COMPLETION.md
```

### Complex PR (With Setup)
```
docs/pr-completions/pr2/
├── PR2_COMPLETION.md
├── PR2_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
├── PR2_SETUP_GUIDE.md
├── PR2_QUICK_START.md
└── SUPABASE_FIX.md
```

## 💡 Tips

- **Be consistent:** Follow the naming convention exactly
- **Think of the user:** If they need to DO something, create a setup guide
- **Separate concerns:** Completion reports ≠ implementation details ≠ setup instructions
- **Update navigation:** Always update docs/README.md when adding new PR docs
- **Archive old docs:** Move deprecated content to docs/archive/

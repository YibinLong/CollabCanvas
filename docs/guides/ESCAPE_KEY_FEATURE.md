# Escape Key Feature - Cancel Shape Creation

## Feature Overview

Added a new keyboard shortcut feature that allows users to cancel shape creation while they're actively drawing a shape.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Canvas Component (`frontend/components/Canvas.tsx`)

**WHY**: Users sometimes start creating a shape and then change their mind mid-drag. They need a way to cancel the creation without completing it.

**WHAT**: Added Escape key handling to cancel in-progress shape creation

**HOW**: 
- Added `removeShape` to the list of functions pulled from `useCanvasStore`
- Extended the keyboard event handler to detect Escape key presses
- When Escape is pressed during shape creation (`interactionMode === 'creating'`):
  - The shape being created is removed from the store using `removeShape()`
  - The interaction state is reset to 'none'
  - All interaction tracking variables are cleared

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Added removeShape to store functions (line 177)
removeShape,

// Updated dependency array to include new dependencies (line 949)
}, [isSpacePressed, deleteSelected, interactionMode, shapes, removeShape, clearSelection])

// Added Escape key handler (lines 882-913)
// Escape key to cancel shape creation
// WHY: Users should be able to cancel a shape they're currently creating if they change their mind
// HOW: When Escape is pressed during shape creation, we remove the in-progress shape and reset state
if (e.key === 'Escape') {
  // Only cancel if we're actively creating a shape (dragging to define size)
  if (interactionMode === 'creating' && interactionStateRef.current.creatingShapeId) {
    e.preventDefault()
    
    // Remove the shape that was being created
    // WHY: Using removeShape() directly is cleaner than selecting then deleting
    const creatingId = interactionStateRef.current.creatingShapeId
    if (shapes.has(creatingId)) {
      removeShape(creatingId)
    }
    
    // Reset the interaction state
    // WHY: We need to clear all interaction state so the canvas returns to normal mode
    setInteractionMode('none')
    interactionStateRef.current = {
      startX: 0,
      startY: 0,
      lastX: 0,
      lastY: 0,
      justFinishedDrag: false,
    }
  }
  // If not creating but other selections exist, clear selection
  // WHY: Escape is commonly used to deselect in design tools
  else if (!isTyping) {
    clearSelection()
  }
}
```

### 2. Tests (`frontend/__tests__/Canvas.test.tsx`)

Added two new test cases:

**Test 1: Escape key cancels shape creation in progress**
- Simulates starting to create a rectangle by clicking and dragging
- Verifies a shape exists in the store during creation
- Presses Escape
- Verifies the shape is removed from the store

**Test 2: Escape key clears selection when not creating**
- Bonus feature: Escape also clears selection when not creating
- This is a common UX pattern in design tools

## How to Test Manually

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Shape Creation Cancellation**:
   - Select any shape tool (Rectangle, Circle, Line, or Text) from the toolbar
   - Click and start dragging on the canvas to create a shape
   - While still dragging (before releasing the mouse), press `Escape`
   - **Expected Result**: The shape disappears and you return to normal mode

3. **Test Selection Clearing**:
   - Create a shape normally (click, drag, release)
   - Click on the shape to select it (you'll see selection handles)
   - Press `Escape`
   - **Expected Result**: The shape is deselected

4. **Test Text Input Safety**:
   - Double-click a text shape to edit it
   - While typing in the text box, press `Escape`
   - **Expected Result**: The text input closes (normal behavior), but no shapes are affected

## User Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can abandon shape creation if they change their mind
2. **Follows Design Tool Conventions**: Escape to cancel/deselect is standard in tools like Figma, Sketch, etc.
3. **No Commitment**: Users can experiment with shape placement without worrying about cleanup
4. **Keyboard Efficiency**: Power users can work faster with keyboard shortcuts

## Bug Fix (Resolved)

**Bug Description**: When pressing Escape during shape creation and then releasing the mouse button, a default-sized shape would be created at the mouse position.

**Root Cause - Event Timing Issue**: 
The problem was subtle and related to event timing:
1. User presses Escape → deletes shape, sets `wasCancelled = true`
2. User releases mouse → `mouseUp` fires first → resets `wasCancelled = false`
3. Then `onClick` fires → sees `wasCancelled = false` → creates a default shape!

The `onClick` event fires AFTER `mouseUp`, so by the time `onClick` checked the flag, it was already reset to false.

**Solution**: 
1. Added a `wasCancelled` flag to track when Escape cancels a shape
2. In `handleMouseUp`, we save the cancelled state BEFORE resetting it
3. We keep `wasCancelled` set to the saved value (not false) when resetting the ref
4. We set `justFinishedDrag = true` when cancelled to double-protect against `onClick`
5. We delay clearing both flags by 50ms to ensure `onClick` has time to check them
6. The `onClick` handler checks BOTH `wasCancelled` and `justFinishedDrag` before creating shapes

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Uses Zustand store's `removeShape()` method for clean deletion
- Properly resets all interaction state to prevent stale references
- Sets `justFinishedDrag = true` to prevent `onClick` from creating shapes after cancellation
- Clears `creatingShapeId` to prevent `mouseUp` from finalizing cancelled shapes
- Doesn't interfere with text editing (checks `isTyping` flag)

### Interaction Modes
The feature works specifically during the 'creating' interaction mode, which is active from:
- Mouse down on empty canvas with a shape tool selected
- Through mouse move while dragging to define size
- Until mouse up (which completes the shape creation) OR Escape key (which cancels)

### Edge Cases Handled
- Only works during active shape creation (not after release)
- Doesn't interfere with typing in text inputs
- Prevents `onClick` from creating shapes after cancellation
- Prevents `mouseUp` from finalizing cancelled shapes
- Clears all interaction state properly
- Works with all shape types (Rectangle, Circle, Line, Text)
- Properly times out the `justFinishedDrag` flag so future clicks work normally

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for this feature:
1. Add visual feedback when Escape is pressed (toast notification)
2. Track cancelled shapes for undo/redo functionality
3. Add sound effect for cancellation (accessibility)
4. Show hint text "Press Escape to cancel" during shape creation

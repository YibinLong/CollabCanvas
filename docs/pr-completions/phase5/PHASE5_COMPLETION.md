# Phase 5: Authentication - COMPLETION REPORT

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**PRs:** #20, #21, #22, #23

### PR #21: Supabase Authentication Implementation ‚úÖ
**Status:** Complete  
**Test Results:** All 23 tests passing

**Frontend Implementation:**

1. **AuthContext Provider** (`frontend/lib/AuthContext.tsx`)
   - Manages global authentication state
   - Provides signup, login, logout functions
   - Handles session persistence via localStorage
   - Auto-refreshes JWT tokens
   - Fetches user metadata (name) from backend

2. **Supabase Client** (`frontend/lib/supabase.ts`)
   - Configured Supabase client with anon key
   - Helper functions for token management
   - User metadata fetching
   - Multiple logout scopes (local, global, others)

3. **Signup Page** (`frontend/app/signup/page.tsx`)
   - Email, password, and name input
   - Client-side validation
   - Error handling and display
   - Slow load detection (for backend warmup)
   - Redirects to canvas on success

4. **Login Page** (`frontend/app/login/page.tsx`)
   - Email and password input
   - Authentication with Supabase
   - Error handling
   - Redirects to canvas on success

5. **Root Layout Update** (`frontend/app/layout.tsx`)
   - Wraps entire app with AuthProvider
   - Makes auth state available everywhere

**Backend Implementation:**

1. **Auth Controller** (`backend/src/controllers/authController.ts`)
   - `signup()` - Saves user metadata (name) to Prisma
   - `login()` - Validates credentials, returns JWT
   - `logout()` - Invalidates session
   - `getCurrentUser()` - Returns user profile

2. **Auth Routes** (`backend/src/routes/authRoutes.ts`)
   - `POST /api/auth/signup` - Public
   - `POST /api/auth/login` - Public
   - `POST /api/auth/logout` - Protected
   - `GET /api/auth/me` - Protected

3. **JWT Middleware** (`backend/src/middleware/auth.ts`)
   - `authenticateJWT()` - Validates JWT tokens
   - Extracts user ID from token
   - Attaches userId to request object
   - Returns 401 for invalid/expired tokens

---

### PR #22: Auth Integration Tests ‚úÖ
**Status:** Complete  
**Tests Written:** 10 integration tests passing

**What Was Tested:**
- All API routes require authentication
- Documents are linked to creator (owner_id)
- Only users can access their own documents
- User identity available in presence system
- Token expiration handling
- Malformed token rejection

---

### PR #23: Auth Integration Implementation ‚úÖ
**Status:** Complete  
**Test Results:** All 10 integration tests passing

**Features Implemented:**

1. **Protected Routes (Frontend)**
   - Main canvas page (`/`) redirects to `/login` if not authenticated
   - Uses `useEffect` to check auth state
   - Shows loading state during auth check

2. **Protected API Endpoints (Backend)**
   - All document routes use `authenticateJWT` middleware
   - `GET /api/documents` - Returns only user's documents
   - `POST /api/documents` - Creates document with owner_id
   - `DELETE /api/documents/:id` - Only owner can delete
   - `POST /api/documents/:id/clear` - Only owner can clear

3. **User Identity in Presence**
   - `usePresence` hook receives authenticated user data
   - Displays real name instead of "Anonymous"
   - Color assignment based on user ID
   - UserAvatars component shows authenticated users

4. **Document Ownership**
   - All documents linked to creator via `owner_id`
   - Prisma queries filtered by userId
   - Users can only see/modify their own documents

5. **Token Management**
   - Frontend sends JWT in Authorization header
   - Backend validates token on every request
   - Auto-refresh prevents session expiration
   - Graceful handling of expired tokens

## Key Features Delivered

### üîê Security
- JWT-based authentication with Supabase
- All API endpoints protected with middleware
- Passwords never sent to backend (handled by Supabase)
- Token auto-refresh prevents session expiration
- Row-level security via document ownership

### üë§ User Experience
- Beautiful, modern signup/login pages
- Real-time error feedback
- Session persistence (stay logged in on refresh)
- Slow load detection (friendly message during backend warmup)
- User profile displayed in UI
- Real names shown in presence system

### üîó Integration
- Authentication seamlessly integrated with:
  - Canvas page (protected route)
  - Document API (ownership)
  - Presence system (user identity)
  - WebSocket connections (JWT validation ready)

## User Flows

### New User Signup
1. User navigates to `/signup`
2. Enters name, email, password

6. User redirected to canvas
7. Session persisted to localStorage

### Returning User Login
1. User navigates to `/login`
2. Enters email and password
3. Supabase validates credentials
4. Returns JWT token
5. Frontend fetches user metadata

2. AuthProvider checks session
3. If not authenticated ‚Üí redirect to `/login`
4. If authenticated ‚Üí show canvas
5. User identity shown in header

## Technical Decisions

### Why Supabase?
- Built-in authentication service
- JWT token management
- Secure password hashing
- Auto token refresh
- Easy to set up and deploy
- Free tier sufficient for MVP

### Why Split Auth Data?
- Supabase Auth stores: email, password (hashed), user ID
- Prisma DB stores: user ID, name, avatarUrl
- **Benefit:** More secure (passwords isolated from app data)
- **Benefit:** Flexibility to add custom user fields
- **Trade-off:** Requires two API calls on signup

### Why JWT Middleware?
- Stateless authentication (no session storage needed)
- Scalable (works with multiple backend instances)
- Standard approach (Authorization: Bearer token)
- Easy to integrate with WebSocket connections

## What's Next?

Phase 5 is **100% complete**! Next up:

### Phase 6: Advanced Canvas Features
- Arrow key movement
- Duplicate shapes (Cmd+D)
- Copy/Paste
- Color picker
- Alignment tools

These features will improve the rubric scoring for "Advanced Figma-Inspired Features"!

---

## Notes for Future Development

### Areas for Enhancement (Not in MVP)
- Email verification on signup
- Password reset flow
- OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access control
- Document sharing with other users
- Team workspaces

### Known Limitations
- Backend warmup time (30-60s) on Render free tier
  - **Solution:** BackendWarmup component pings on page load
  - **Solution:** Friendly "waking up" message shown
- JWT tokens expire after 1 hour (Supabase default)
  - **Solution:** Auto-refresh implemented
- No email verification required
  - **Trade-off:** Faster signup, but less secure

## Congratulations! üéâ

Phase 5 is complete! You now have a fully functional, secure authentication system with:
- 33 tests passing
- Beautiful UI
- Protected routes
- Document ownership
- User identity in presence

The app is ready for Phase 6: Advanced Canvas Features!

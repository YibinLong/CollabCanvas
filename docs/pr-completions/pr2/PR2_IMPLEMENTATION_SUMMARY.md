# PR#2: Database Schema & Prisma Setup - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED TASKS**

### 1. **Prisma Schema Created** (`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`)

**What it does**: Defines the database structure with 3 main tables.

**Tables created**:
- ‚úÖ **User** - Stores user profile information (id, email, name, avatarUrl)
- ‚úÖ **Document** - Stores canvas documents with Yjs state (id, title, ownerId, yjsState)
- ‚úÖ **DocumentVersion** - Stores historical snapshots for version history

**Why these fields**:
- `id`: Unique identifier (UUID) - every record needs a unique ID
- `yjsState`: Stores the entire canvas as binary data (Yjs serializes the canvas state)
- Relations: Documents belong to Users, Versions belong to Documents
- Indexes: Speed up common queries (finding documents by owner)
- Timestamps: Track when things were created/updated (helpful for debugging)

---

### 2. **Database Seed Script** (`backend/prisma/seed.ts`)

**What it does**: Populates the database with test data for development.

**Test data created**:
- 2 test users: Alice Designer and Bob Developer
- 3 test documents owned by these users

**Why**: You need sample data to test features as you build them. Instead of manually creating users/documents every time, the seed script does it automatically.

---

### 3. **Prisma Client Utility** (`backend/src/utils/prisma.ts`)

**What it does**: Creates a single, reusable database connection.

**Why**: 
- Creating multiple Prisma clients wastes resources
- This singleton pattern ensures only one connection exists
- In development, it prevents connection leaks during hot reload
- Includes logging in development mode for debugging

**How to use it**: Import `prisma` from this file anywhere you need to query the database.

---

### 4. **Database Connection Test** (`backend/src/utils/test-db-connection.ts`)

**What it does**: Verifies your Supabase connection is working correctly.

**Tests performed**:
1. Can connect to database?
2. Can run queries?
3. Shows database version info

**Why**: Before building features, you need to confirm the database setup is correct. This script provides clear success/error messages.

---

### 5. **Updated package.json Scripts**

Added convenient npm scripts for Prisma operations:

```json
"prisma:generate": "prisma generate",       // Generate TypeScript types
"prisma:migrate": "prisma migrate dev",     // Create/apply migrations
"prisma:studio": "prisma studio",           // Visual database browser
"prisma:seed": "tsx prisma/seed.ts",        // Populate test data
"db:push": "prisma db push",                // Quick schema sync (dev only)
"db:reset": "prisma migrate reset",         // Reset database (‚ö†Ô∏è deletes data)
"test:db": "tsx src/utils/test-db-connection.ts"  // Test connection
```

**Why**: These scripts make database operations easy. Instead of remembering long commands, you just run `npm run prisma:migrate`.

---

### 6. **Environment Variable Templates**

Created `.env.example` files for both backend and frontend.

**What they contain**:
- Backend: Database URL, Supabase keys, server config
- Frontend: API URLs, Supabase public keys

**Why**: 
- Shows developers what environment variables are needed
- Safe to commit to Git (no actual secrets)
- Makes setup easier for new developers

---

### 7. **Documentation**

Created comprehensive guides:
- **PR2_SETUP_GUIDE.md**: Detailed step-by-step instructions with explanations
- **PR2_QUICK_START.md**: Quick reference for experienced developers
- **This file**: Summary of what was implemented and why

---

## üîç **WHAT EACH PIECE DOES (For Beginners)**

### **Prisma Schema = Blueprint**
Think of `schema.prisma` as the blueprint for your database. It says:
- "I need a table called 'users' with these columns"
- "I need a table called 'documents' that links to users"
- Prisma reads this and creates the actual database tables

### **Migrations = Version Control for Database**
When you run `prisma migrate`, Prisma:
1. Looks at your schema
2. Compares it to your actual database
3. Generates SQL commands to update the database
4. Saves these commands in `prisma/migrations/` folder
5. This way you can track database changes over time (like Git for your database structure)

### **Prisma Client = Type-Safe Database Access**
When you run `prisma generate`, Prisma creates TypeScript code that lets you query the database:

```typescript
// Without Prisma (raw SQL - error-prone)
const result = await db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", [userId]);

// With Prisma (type-safe, autocomplete works!)
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: userId }
});
```

The client knows about your schema, so your editor can autocomplete field names and catch typos!

### **Seed Script = Test Data Generator**
Instead of manually creating test users in Prisma Studio every time you reset the database, the seed script does it automatically. Run `npm run prisma:seed` and boom - you have Alice, Bob, and 3 test documents ready to go.

## üîí **SECURITY NOTES**

- ‚úÖ `.env` files are in `.gitignore` (won't be committed)
- ‚úÖ Only `.env.example` files are committed (safe templates)
- ‚úÖ Supabase service_role key should NEVER be in frontend (only backend)
- ‚úÖ Frontend only gets the anon/public key (which is safe to expose)

---

## üìä **DATABASE RELATIONSHIPS**

```
User (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ< (many) Document (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ< (many) DocumentVersion
   |                      |                           |
   ‚îî‚îÄ Has many           ‚îî‚îÄ Has many                 ‚îî‚îÄ Is a snapshot
      documents              versions                    of a document
```

**Example**:
- Alice (User) owns "My First Canvas" (Document)
- "My First Canvas" has 5 saved versions (DocumentVersion)
- Each version is a snapshot of the canvas at different times

---

## üß™ **TESTING THE SETUP**

After the user creates `.env` files and runs commands, they should see:

```
üîç Testing database connection...

Test 1: Connecting to database...
‚úÖ Connected successfully!

Test 2: Running test query...
‚úÖ Query successful!
   - Users in database: 2
   - Documents in database: 3

Test 3: Database info...
‚úÖ Database version: PostgreSQL

üéâ All tests passed! Database connection is working.
```

## ‚è≠Ô∏è **NEXT STEPS (After User Completes Setup)**

Once the user:
1. ‚úÖ Creates Supabase project
2. ‚úÖ Creates `.env` files
3. ‚úÖ Runs all commands successfully
4. ‚úÖ Sees "All tests passed!"

Then PR#2 is **COMPLETE** and we can move to:
- **PR#3**: Testing Infrastructure Setup (Jest, React Testing Library)

---

## üí° **KEY LEARNINGS FOR USER**

1. **Supabase** = Your PostgreSQL database in the cloud (free tier is generous!)
2. **Prisma** = Makes working with databases easier and safer (type-safe queries)
3. **Migrations** = Track database structure changes over time
4. **Environment variables** = Keep secrets out of Git, configure different environments
5. **Seeding** = Automatically create test data for development

---

## üÜò **IF SOMETHING BREAKS**

Run these commands to start fresh:

```bash
cd backend
npm run db:reset     # ‚ö†Ô∏è Deletes all data and reruns migrations
npm run prisma:seed  # Add test data back
npm run test:db      # Verify it works
```

---

**Status**: Implementation complete, waiting for user to run setup commands.

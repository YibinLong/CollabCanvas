# Documentation Organization - Summary

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Action:** Cleaned up root folder and organized all documentation

---

## 🎯 What Was Done

Moved all PR-specific and supplementary documentation from the root folder into a structured `docs/` directory.

## ✅ Root Folder (Clean!)

Only essential project files remain in root:

```
Figma_Clone/
├── README.md          # Main project readme
├── PRD.md             # Product requirements
├── TASK_LIST.md       # Development roadmap
├── backend/           # Backend code
├── frontend/          # Frontend code
└── docs/              # All documentation (organized)
```

- Keeps root folder clean

### 2. docs/README.md
Central documentation index with:
- Folder structure explanation

## 🔄 Future PR Process

For every future PR:

   mkdir -p docs/pr-completions/pr#
   ```

2. **Add completion documentation:**
   - Minimum: `PR#_COMPLETION.md`
   - As needed: Setup guides, summaries, etc.

3. **Update indexes:**
   - Update `docs/README.md` with new PR
   - Update `TASK_LIST.md` status

4. **Keep root clean:**

   - Only README, PRD, TASK_LIST stay in root

# 🎉 Testing Real-Time Collaboration - Step-by-Step Guide

## ✅ Integration Complete!

All Phase 3 collaboration features are now wired up and ready to test!

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Start the Servers

### Terminal 1: Backend Server
```bash
cd /Users/yibin/Documents/WORKZONE/VSCODE/GAUNTLET_AI/1_Week/Figma_Clone/backend
npm run dev
```

**Wait for this output:**
```
✓ WebSocket server initialized
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:4000
🔌 WebSocket server running on ws://localhost:4000
📊 Health check: http://localhost:4000/health
✓ Backend setup complete!
```

### Terminal 2: Frontend Server
```bash
cd /Users/yibin/Documents/WORKZONE/VSCODE/GAUNTLET_AI/1_Week/Figma_Clone/frontend
npm run dev
```

**Wait for this output:**
```
▲ Next.js 14.x.x
- Local:   http://localhost:3000
✓ Ready in Xms
```

## 🧪 Step 2: Open Multiple Browser Windows

1. Open your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
2. Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000**
3. Open a **NEW window** (not tab - easier to see side by side)
4. Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000** in the new window
5. Arrange windows **side by side** on your screen

**Pro tip:** Use split-screen (Windows: Win+Left/Right, Mac: Mission Control)

---

## 🎨 Step 3: Test Collaboration Features!

### Test 1: Shape Sync ✨
1. **Window A:** Click the Rectangle tool in the toolbar
2. **Window A:** Click anywhere on the canvas to create a rectangle
3. **Window B:** 👀 **Watch the rectangle appear instantly!**

**Expected:** Rectangle appears in Window B within ~100ms

### Test 2: Real-Time Movement 🚀
1. **Window A:** Click and drag the rectangle to move it
2. **Window B:** 👀 **Watch it move in real-time!**

**Expected:** Smooth movement in both windows

### Test 3: Multiple Shapes 🎨
1. **Window A:** Create a circle
2. **Window B:** Create a line
3. **Both windows:** 👀 **Both shapes appear in both windows!**

**Expected:** All shapes sync to all windows

### Test 4: Multiplayer Cursors 👆
1. **Window A:** Move your mouse around the canvas
2. **Window B:** 👀 **See a cursor with a user name following your mouse!**

**Expected:** See "User XX" label with a colored cursor

### Test 5: Shape Operations ✏️
1. **Window A:** Select and resize a shape
2. **Window B:** 👀 **Watch the resize happen live!**
3. **Window A:** Delete a shape
4. **Window B:** 👀 **Shape disappears!**

**Expected:** All operations sync

### Test 6: Three Windows! 🤯
1. Open a **third** browser window to localhost:3000
2. Create shapes in each window
3. 👀 **All three windows stay in perfect sync!**

**Expected:** Works with any number of windows

---

## 🔍 What You Should See

### ✅ In Each Window:
- **Top Left:** "select Tool" indicator
- **Bottom Right:** Zoom percentage (100%)
- **Canvas:** Grid background
- **Other Users' Cursors:** Moving colored cursors with names

### ✅ In Browser Console (F12):
Open DevTools (F12) and check the Console tab:
```
[Yjs] Connection status: connecting
[Yjs] Connection status: connected
[Yjs] Syncing shape to Yjs: shape-xxx
```

### ✅ In Backend Terminal:
```
[WebSocket] New connection from ::1
[WebSocket] Client joined room: test-document-123
[WebSocket] Received remote update
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Cannot connect" error in browser console

**Solution:**
1. Make sure backend is running (check Terminal 1)
2. Verify you see "WebSocket server running" message
3. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

### Problem: Shapes don't sync

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify both windows show "Connected" in console logs
3. Restart both servers (Ctrl+C, then npm run dev)

### Problem: Backend won't start (port in use)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find process on port 4000
lsof -i :4000

# Kill it
kill -9 <PID>

# Try again
npm run dev
```

### Problem: Frontend won't start (port in use)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find process on port 3000
lsof -i :3000

# Kill it
kill -9 <PID>

# Try again
npm run dev
```

### Problem: Cursor doesn't show up

**Check:**
- Move your mouse **inside the canvas area** (gray grid)
- You won't see your own cursor (only other windows see it)
- Other window must be open and connected

---

## 📊 Performance Check

### Network Traffic
Open DevTools → Network tab → WS (WebSockets):
- Should see connection to `ws://localhost:4000`
- Status: 101 Switching Protocols (success)
- Small messages flowing (~10-100 bytes each)

### Sync Latency
- Create a shape in Window A
- Time how long until it appears in Window B
- **Expected:** 50-150ms (under 1 second!)

### FPS (Frames Per Second)
- Open DevTools → Performance
- Record while moving shapes
- **Expected:** Solid 60 FPS

## 🎬 Demo Script (Show Someone)

**"Let me show you real-time collaboration!"**

1. **Setup:** Open 2 windows side by side
2. **Introduce:** "This is a collaborative canvas, like Figma"
3. **Draw:** Create rectangle in left → "Watch the right window"
4. **Sync:** "See? Instant! Under 100 milliseconds"
5. **Move:** Drag shape in left → "Real-time updates"
6. **Cursor:** Point to right window → "That's my cursor!"
7. **Multi-user:** Create shape in right → "Works both ways"
8. **Scale:** "It handles multiple users seamlessly"

---

## 📈 What's Happening Behind the Scenes

### When You Create a Shape:

```
1. You click → Canvas creates shape
2. Zustand store updates (local React state)
3. useYjsSync detects the change
4. Yjs creates a tiny "diff" message (~50 bytes)
5. WebSocket sends to server
6. Server broadcasts to all other clients
7. Other clients' Yjs receives the update
8. Other clients' Zustand updates
9. Other clients' React re-renders
10. Shape appears! (~50-100ms total)
```

### When You Move Your Cursor:

```
1. Mouse moves → handleMouseMove fires
2. Throttled to 10 updates/second
3. usePresence broadcasts position
4. Yjs Awareness sends to server
5. Server forwards to other clients
6. CursorOverlay component re-renders
7. Your cursor appears with your name!
```

## ✨ Cool Things to Try

### Test Latency
1. Window A: Create 10 rectangles quickly
2. Window B: Count how fast they appear
3. Result: Should be nearly instant!

### Test Scale
1. Create 50+ shapes
2. Verify smooth performance
3. All shapes sync correctly

### Test Persistence (Coming in Phase 4!)
1. Create some shapes
2. Close ALL browser windows
3. Reopen → Shapes are GONE (no persistence yet)
4. Phase 4 will add PostgreSQL to save them!

### Test Disconnect/Reconnect
1. Stop backend server (Ctrl+C)
2. Frontend console shows: "disconnected"
3. Restart backend
4. Frontend auto-reconnects!
5. Create shapes → syncing works again!

---

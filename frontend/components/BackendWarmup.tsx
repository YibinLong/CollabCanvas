/**
 * Backend Warmup Component
 * 
 * WHY: Free-tier hosting services (like Render) spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity.
 * This can cause a 50+ second delay when users try to login/signup because the backend
 * needs to "wake up" first.
 * 
 * WHAT: This component pings the backend's /health endpoint as soon as the page loads.
 * By the time the user clicks "Login" or "Sign Up", the backend is already awake!
 * 
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * 1. Runs immediately when any page loads (mounted in root layout)
 * 2. Sends a lightweight GET request to /health endpoint
 * 3. Runs silently in background - doesn't block page load or show errors
 * 4. Only pings once per page load (not repeatedly)
